# scripts
These are miscellaneous and helper scripts that I have written to make my life easier



## clear docker images
This does exactly what it sayd, it simply clears the docker images and layers from my system

### topwatch
This will grab one value from "top".  This is ideally run in cron.  A good reference for adding cron is [here](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-add-jobs-to-cron-under-linux-or-unix-oses/)
